🚀 Project I: Instagram Hashtag Generator
"Great content deserves to be seen. Automation makes it happen."

Instagram Hashtag Generator is a Social Media Automation tool designed to streamline your posting workflow. It instantly generates high-volume, niche-specific hashtags based on your category and automatically copies them to your clipboard, saving you from the hassle of manual typing.

🚀 How It Works
This tool uses Python's data structures and system clipboard access to automate the growth process.

- Category Detection: Uses a robust Dictionary lookup to find trending tags for niches like Gaming, Coding, Travel, and Food.

- Smart Shuffling: Applies a random.shuffle() algorithm to mix up the hashtags every time. This ensures unique combinations to prevent Instagram from flagging posts as spam (Anti-Shadowban).

- Clipboard Automation: Leverages the pyperclip library to instantly copy the generated output, making it ready for a one-click paste (Ctrl+V).
